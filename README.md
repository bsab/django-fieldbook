django-fieldbook
=========

django-fieldbook is a reusable Django app for interacting with the Fieldbook_ API.
Fieldbook is the fastest and easiest way to create custom information tools.
Itâ€™s as easy to get started with as a spreadsheet, but gives you all the power of a
database-driven business application. Teams use it to track projects and clients,
implement data collection workflows, and create custom content management systems.
